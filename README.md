# Dungeon Dread

The world in Dungeon Dread has multiple dungeons where zombies/monsters exist. The dungeon boss controls them. Our main character is a zombie/monster hunter. Initially, our character is equipped with a weaker weapon. As he kills zombies and collects rewards, the character can buy weapons at the end of the wave. The boss appears at the final wave. The game's objective is to survive each wave and defeat the boss. Boss is much stronger than a regular monster/zombie. Stronger in the sense of higher damage and higher health. After defeating the boss, the dungeon's remaining monsters/zombies disappear and the dungeon is free of monsters/zombies.
